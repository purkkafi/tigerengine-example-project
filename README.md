# TigerEngine Example Project

An example project for [Tiger Engine](https://github.com/purkkafi/tiger-engine), a Godot-based work-in-progress visual novel engine. It is both a tutorial you can examine to figure out how the engine works and a canonical project template you can copy to get started with a new game project.

**Note:** the engine is included as a submodule. Clone the repository like this:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/purkkafi/tigerengine-example-project`

After cloning, you should be able to open and run the project in Godot 4.
